# Welcome to Jekyll

This is your first tech blog post! Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for technical blogs. In this post, we'll explore some of the key features that make Jekyll great for writing technical articles.

## Why Jekyll for Tech Blogs?

Jekyll offers several advantages for technical writing:

1. **Markdown Support**: Write your posts in Markdown, which is perfect for technical documentation
2. **Code Highlighting**: Built-in syntax highlighting for code blocks
3. **Git Integration**: Version control your content with Git
4. **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository
5. **Fast Performance**: Static sites load quickly and are SEO-friendly

## Code Examples

One of the best features of Jekyll for tech blogs is its excellent code highlighting. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Jekyll configuration example
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, Tech Blog!"
end
```

You can also include code in different languages:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the tech blog.`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

```python
# Python example
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate Fibonacci sequence"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)

print(calculate_fibonacci(10))
```

## Writing Technical Content

When writing technical blog posts, consider:

- **Clear Structure**: Use headings to organize your content
- **Code Examples**: Include working code snippets
- **Explanations**: Don't just show code, explain why it works
- **Best Practices**: Share industry standards and recommendations
- **Real-World Context**: Connect concepts to practical applications

## Getting Started

To get started with your own Jekyll blog:

1. Install Jekyll and dependencies
2. Create your first post in the `_posts` directory
3. Customize your `_config.yml`
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Next Steps
